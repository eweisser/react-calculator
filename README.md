# react-calculator
A small calculator with React!

Note: This project has been superseded by my newer React calculator project, which uses Node.js (https://github.com/eweisser/react-calculator-app).

This single-page calculator was my first foray into React. It was written in JSX and then translated using the Babel online translator at https://babeljs.io/repl. Originally, it was an assignment for a job application, but I decided I want to keep improving on it, eventually leading me to replace it entirely with the Node.js version.
